# Procedure 
1. Requirement Phase
    1. Select a theme/Project Idea/Topic/Product
    2. Research 
        * Ageing 
        * Cost Gradation
    3. Define your solution 
    4. SWOT Analysis Your Solution
    5. Requirements 
        - Low Level (technical Specification requirements)
        - High level (service providers for low level requirements)

    Format - Requirement ID| Description

2. Design Phase
    1. High Level (data flow, flow charts and data structures are covered under HLD.)
        Behavioral Diagram (2 min)
        Structural Diagram (2 min)
    2. Low Level(Logic)
        Behavioral Diagram (2min)
        Structural Diagram (2 min)

3. Test Plan 
    - High Level/ Integration Test Plan 
    - Low Level/ Unit Test Plan 

    Format - Test ID | Description | Precondition | Expected IO| Expected OP| Actual OP

 
4. Implementation in respective module

    CI framework 
        GIT (we will be using gitinspectors for analysis of GIT repos)
        Build and Make - Github Actions 
        Unit Test Framework 
        Code Quality 
    Activities to make yourself comfortable with CI 
        3 file system - 1 .H 1 .C and 1.YML (Build through gcc command)
        4 File System - Same as above + Make file (Build through make)
