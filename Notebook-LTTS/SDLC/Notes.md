    SDLC Notes


    High Level Design:

        User Interface Requirements
        shows Functionality Architecture
        Dynamic View UML (Behavioral)

            Dataflow chart 
            Use Case Diagram
            Activity

    Low Level Design(Developer)
    Logic of Individual Components
    Static view UML(Structural)
    Class Diagram
    Component or Package Diagram

    Design Diagrams 
    1. use case diagram or sequence diagram
    2. Activity or Flow Chart Diagram
    3. Class or Object Diagram
    4. Component or Package Diagram
    * UML Diagrams
        - Structural ()
        - Behaviaral (Componet level,sequence diagram)

7. Test Plan(Requirement,Scenario,Boundary Conditions)
    - Integration Test PLan 
        * test id
        * descriptiom
        * expected input
        * expected output
    - Unit Test Plan
    - high level to low level traceability

## Challanges 
* Power Backup
* Traceability 

## Testing
* Testing should be done so that product is defect free when it is delivered to the user.
* Testing ensures that products do not receive recalls of products.
* Testing assures high quality of product and ensures product follow strict guidelines and standards which will enhance sales of products thereby increases the profitability of company.
* Testing saves huge amount of money to company, because if testing is not done at each stage, it can possibly lead to problems when product is launched, which will incur huge losses to company.

## Todo 
1. Self study
2. understanding TDLC and TDD
    4w1h
    what,why,where,when,how
3. Application of Mini Project(TDLC and TDD)
