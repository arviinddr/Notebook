* They are typically placed in the ~/.bashrc (bash) 
* In the bash syntax no spaces are permitted around the equal sign. If value contains spaces or tabs, you must enclose value within quotation marks. 
* The choice of single or double quotation marks is significant in the alias syntax when the alias includes variables. If you enclose value within double quotation marks, any variables that appear in value are expanded when the alias is created. If you enclose value within single quotation marks, variables are not expanded until the alias is used.

# Syntax
    alias [name[=value]]
