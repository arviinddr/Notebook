# Outline

## Concept Checking / Discussion Points

* A non object oriented example [example](example1.cxx)
* writing simple class [example](example2.cxx)
* public, private access specifiers
* creation of objects, calling operations
* Identify error when access to private member is attempted
* Object state
* Defining functions outside the class [example](example3.cxx)
* Multifile approach [example](multi)
* immutable operations - const member functions [example](example4.cxx)
* Where to suffix const keyword, when defining outside?
* `this` keyword - address of object by which member function is invoked
* `this` as hidden parameter for non static functions, which binds to address of calling object
