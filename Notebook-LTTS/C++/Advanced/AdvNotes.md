## Linked 


## Trivial Classes in C++

* has compiler provided special member functions
* contiguous memory area occupied
* 

1. Type of Objects
    * Trivial and Non Trivial Objects
    Trivial Copy constructor is given by the compiler

## Move Schematics(Move Constr)
    * In Scenario the duplicate heap blocks are created
    * best convention is to transfer the heap block
    *   move assignment is done for the Temp objects and Named objects by type casting
    *   perfect forwarding
    *   to call l-value and r-value dedicated

## Lamdas 
    * used to write temporary function
    * Lambdas for effective callback mechanism, without the need for defining named functions inadvance
