# Problem Statement - Banking Account

## Point class
* Design Point in 2D space as generic class
  * Data members - x, y coordinates
  * Suitable constructors
  * find distance between two points
  * find the new point when flipped a) horizontally b) vertically
  * displace a point by dx, dy units
  * Any other functions as part of public interface (as per operations on collection) 

## Collection class
  * Create a collection of points using suitable STL container
  * Implement following operations on the collection
    * addPoint
    * display all points
    * count all points in a particular quadrant
    * count all points lies on a circle boundary with given radius
    * find all points in a particular quadrant
    * find all points lies on a circle boundary with given radius
    * count all points in a particular quadrant
    * count all points which are within a circle boundary of given radius

## Class Diagram
